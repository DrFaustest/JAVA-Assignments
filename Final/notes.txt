building a maze pathfinder

the pathfinder should change any visited space to a 2
if the finder encounters a dead end it will backtrack to the next available unvisited tile
backtracking will change the 2 value to a 3 indicating that the path was visited, resulted in a dead end and is impassable
to do this we will need a deadend boolean so that the changes are made but allow for multiple runs of the maze

once a path is found
scan for 0's in the 2d array 
if found run again searching out untraveled paths 

save successfull paths to a distance varriable that stores coordanates

once all paths a traveled calculate the shortest path 

when printing the solution
the walls should print in the default color (white or black) *
deadend paths should print red @ symbols
the shortest path should be green @symbols
